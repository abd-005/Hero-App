### HERO.IO - A Modern App Marketplace

Welcome to HERO.IO! This is a modern, performance-focused web application I built to showcase mobile apps. My main goal for this project was to leverage modern React features to create a clean, snappy, and dynamic user experience.

### Features & Philosophy

I focused on incorporating features that make the application fast, reliable, and user-friendly.

Seamless Navigation: Explore individual apps with unique, dynamic pages, all handled smoothly by react-router. The experience is designed to be fluid and intuitive.

Centralized State Management: To keep the application's data flow clean and predictable, I used React's built-in Context API along with the useReducer Hook for robust global state management.

Stunning Data Visualization: App ratings are brought to life with beautiful, interactive bar charts powered by Recharts, making data both informative and visually appealing.

Peak Performance:

Code splitting with React.lazy and Suspense ensures a lightning-fast initial page load.

Unnecessary re-renders are prevented using React.memo and useMemo to keep the UI snappy.

The UI remains responsive even during heavy operations (like live search) thanks to the useTransition Hook.

Data Persistence: A user's list of installed apps is saved to localStorage, so their data persists across sessions.

Fully Responsive: Built with Tailwind CSS, the entire application is fully responsive and looks great on all devices, from small mobile screens to large desktops.

Interactive Feedback: Users receive clear and pleasant feedback on their actions through notifications from React Toastify.
